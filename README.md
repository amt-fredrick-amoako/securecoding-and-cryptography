A. Secure Coding Fundamentals
1. Research Common Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection: Occurs when unvalidated input is used to construct SQL queries.
Mitigation: Use prepared statements or ORM frameworks like Hibernate.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into a web application.
Mitigation: Sanitize user inputs and use libraries like OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer.
Insecure Deserialization: Malicious object deserialization leading to code execution.
Mitigation: Validate input and avoid deserializing untrusted data.

B. Securing User Data with Cryptography
1. Cryptographic Concepts

Encryption: Converting plain text into ciphertext.
Decryption: Converting ciphertext back to plain text.
Symmetric Encryption: Same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
Asymmetric Encryption: Different keys for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA).
Hashing: Irreversible data transformation for integrity (e.g., SHA-256).
